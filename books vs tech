The use of books in schools should be replaced with modern technologies such as
computers and all online resources according to some groups of people. 
In my opinion, books are still indispensable in schools and should be used along with the latest
technologies to make students develop more skills.



To begin with, stopping the use of books in schools and completely replacing them with
computers and online resources is an extremely bad idea since books are still an
important learning material for students. All books are written by professionals such as
doctors of education who have expertise in the subject that students are studying. They can
learn more high-quality information which they cannot acquire from reading articles
online since those are suspiciously biased or less credible. Aside from that, by using books
as study material in schools, students can develop reading and researching skills better as
they are less distractive compared to the use of online resources or computers, which
are oftentimes challenged by technical problems that just make students lose interest in
learning.
On the other hand, I also believe that instead of abolishing the use of books in schools,
integrating the use of modern technologies in schools is way beneficial in this digital era.
Schools should make their students equipped with technical skills so they can be
competitive. Nowadays, computer skills and video creation skills are a must in most
industries, in order for students to get better opportunities in the job market, they must
have good technical knowledge, and the best way to achieve that is to make students
knowledgeable in using computers.
